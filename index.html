        <img style="height:250px;width:250px;" src="./assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile picture" />
        <p>Hi, I am B.S. Henrik Storch, <span id="age"></span> years old from Stuttgart, Germany.<br />
            I started developing iOS apps back in 2012 using Objective-C, the first programing language I came to know.
            Later, I did my High School graduation in Computer Science and studied Informatics at the Cooperative State
            University of Baden-Wuerttemberg (DHBW) Stuttgart. Nowadays, I spend my time with my own ideas and personal
            projects.<br />
            In my free time I also enjoy making music, especially on trumpet, piano, or ukulele. I am also currently pursuing a
            PPL-A pilot license. Furthermore, I am volunteering in a world-wide bible education work (learn more <a target="_blank"

        <h1>My Experiences:</h1>
        <h3>WWDC20</h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thisIsTheFoxe/WWDC20">Link to my 2020 Playground</a>
        <p>2020 was an interesting year. The COVID-19 pandemic changed everything. One of the small changes was the
            renaming of #WWDCScholars to #SwiftStudentChallenge. The bigger change was that the entire WWDC would be
            hosted as an online-only event. For that reason (and because I was busy writing my bachelor's thesis), I did
            not put as much work into my playground as in my previous submissions.<br />
            However, I didn't want to just give up, especially knowing and supporting the entire community that formed around
            this event. So, I gave myself 24 hours right when they announced #WWDC20. Within this time I came up with
            the idea to make a little 2D SpriteKit game about my favorite TV show, Community. I used some third-party
            assets and put it all together nicely to create a 2-minute interactive experience. At the end I wrote my
            essays and submitted everything in time. That was the earliest I have ever submitted a WWDCScholars
            submission.<br />
            As expected, my work was too quick & dirty to receive special attention. That makes me happy, because it
            proves (at least to me) that Apple's judgment process is working and fair (contrary to what others have
            claimed).<br />
            Since I am finishing my studies, #WWDC20 will probably be the last time I submitted a student submission. I
            did have a lot of fun and I'm sure that I will cherish all the experiences I was able to make for the rest
            of my life.
        </p>
        <h3>WWDC19</h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thisIsTheFoxe/WWDC19">Link to my 2019 PlaygroundBook</a>
        <p>By now I've been quite active in the WWDCScholars community.
            It felt so good getting Slack and Telegram notification from all those WWDC groups again, which all have
            been pretty silent for almost a year now...
            (Btw, since 2019 there exists a new OFFICIAL WWDCScholars Discord Server! For more information contact me or anyone
            else from the WWDCScholars Team) ..And as soon as Apple announced WWDC19, I too began to think about
            participating.<br />
            I ended up with an idea that I got from a "Formal Languages and Automata" lecture I had at university.
            The thing that impressed me the most was the fact that with a few basic operations you could calculate
            virtually everything!
            So I decided to create my own programing-language which would only use emoji and, as said, just a few basic
            operations, because why not? :D<br />
            The name of this language is: <i>DubDubMachine</i> and you can also find the specs on <a
                target="_blank" href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/DubDubMachine">esolangs.org</a><br />
            Sadly (and due to <q>a record-breaking number of incredible [...] submissions</q>), my PlaygroundsBook
            wasn't accepted for a scholarship this year...
            However, I had a blast enjoying the Keynote and especially trying out new stuff with SwiftUI and I already
            have plans to use it in my next projects.
            Also, as many other scholars put it: <br />
            <q>This year showed me how special the WWDC really is and what an immense privilege it is to be invited
                there.</q> I will definitely not give up now and couldn't be more exited about #WWDC20
        </p>
        <h3>WWDC18</h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thisIsTheFoxe/WWDC18">Link to my 2018 PlaygroundBook</a>
        <p>After I had such an awesome experience last year, I couldn't have been more exited when I saw Apple's
            announcement for &#xF8FF; WWDC18. Once again, I worked hard, while being enrolled in a full-time study
            program, to apply for a scholarship.<br />
            So, I again had the great privilege to join 350 as-amazing scholars from all over the world for one week
            in San Jos&eacute;. Not only that, but this time, right at the start we had the honor to visit the Steve Jobs
            Theater right next to &#xF8FF; Park! It was breathtaking. Everything is designed perfectly, just as you
            would it expect from a company like Apple&trade;.<br />
            The conference itself was no less exciting. With macOS dark mode, ARKit 2.0 and CreateML and so much more
            stuff it was a very awesome week.<br />
            Being there for the second time now, I was able to get much more out of it than last time. In fact, the
            motivational boost I received after dubDub continued for some time, which made me continue working on
            private projects...<br />
            Of course I also met many fellow developers, including Frederik Riedel, Amanda Southworth and Felix Krause.
            The &#xF8FF; World Wide Developer Conference always is a unique experience and I'm very glad I've been a
            part of that.
        </p>
        <h3>HUGO BOSS AG</h3>
        <p>After graduating from High School in winter 2017, I joined an integrated degree program (lit. "dual-study") at HUGO
            BOSS.<br />
            It took me some time to get used to working within a big company and all organizational matters, especially
            getting used to sharing my code, keyword: Git.<br />
            It also helped me to grow personally. Living alone (finally) and making my own money, consequently: Being
            entirely self-responsible.<br />
            I enjoyed working at HUGO BOSS very much and in my opinion it's a great company to work for and with. Having
            a beautiful big headquarters in Metzingen, Germany with many, friendly co-workers who all are ready to help
            and collaborate.</p>
        <h3>WWDC17</h3>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thisIsTheFoxe/WWDC17">Link to my 2017 PlaygroundBook</a>
        <p>It was my greatest honor to be invited to join &Tilde;5000 other developers and software engineers at
            &#xF8FF; WWDC17. <br />
            It was the first time I worked with Playgrounds on a real project and it was both fun and exhausting to
            'write' my PlaygroundBook. And it was even harder, given that I was about to graduate from high school and
            that my finals started a few days after the deadline for application. <br />
            I cannot say in words how HYPED I was, nor the hight that I was jumping, when I finally received <b>that</b>
            email for the first time in my life.<br />
            The conference helped me a lot to have a deeper understanding of Swift and it got me into some very cool new
            APIs which would be important for my further career. Furthermore, it really did a great job in connecting me
            with other developers, even within my area. I got to know one of the founders of the #WWDCScholars: Sam
            Eckert and a some other Apple enthusiasts. One of them eventually tuned out to be my future fellow
            student.<br />
        <h3>Tech. Gymnasium Schw&auml;bisch Gm&uuml;nd</h3>
        <img style="width: 80%; padding: 10px" src="https://www.gs-gd.de/files/theme/images/logo.gif" alt="TG Logo">
        <p>After taking an 'ordinary' school career for almost 10 years, I made the choice to do something new. So, I
            switched schools and spent my final 3 high school years studying computer science, programming and
            digital engineering. I eventually graduated in April 2017.<br />
            This gave me a very strong knowledge base in the field of computer science that I would need later on in my life.<br />

        <p>The very first Internship I had, was back in 2012. It was an IT-Company which also was an authorized reseller
            of Apple&trade; products. <br />
            I really enjoyed it and it increased my interest in technology.<br />

        <p>A friend gave me the idea of creating a game, which's feature it is to keep your finger on the touchscreen
            for as long as possible. A few moments later I started to create a game where you need to dodge obstacles
            flying toward you in Augmented Reality (also using 3D-Touch). Lifting your finger means Game Over!<br />

            Creating a daily to-do list (even if it only has mundane tasks) can increase dopamine production and thus overall
            productivity. I felt that I could do that by providing an alternative to the default iOS Reminders.app, to maximize
            productivity. The result is my first ever published SwiftUI app. <br />
