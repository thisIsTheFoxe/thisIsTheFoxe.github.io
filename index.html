                            <img style="height:250px;width:250px;" src="./profile.jpg"/>
                            <p>My name is Henrik Storch and I am 19 Years old from Stuttgart, Germany.<br/>
                            I started developing iOS App back in 2012 with the first Programing laguage i came to know: Objective-C.
                            It was fun and to be hones more or less just playing around and exporing what one could do with the right tools. </br>
                            After two Years of learning and improving I made the decision to switch from my normal High-School to a more technical High-School which also had Programming Classes.<br/>
                            Three Years later I graduated and started to study Informatics at the Cooperative State University of Baden-Wuerttemberg (DHBW). <br/><br/>
                            In my free time I also enjoy making music, especially on trumpet, piano or ukulele. I too writing music on my own, but haven't published any of it yet. Furthermore, I am volunteering in a world-wide bible education work.

                            <h3>HUGO BOSS AG</h3>
                            <p>After graduating in winter 2017, I started my integrated degree program (lit. "dual-study") at HUGO BOSS.<br/>
                            It took me quite some time to get used to working within a big company and all organisazional matter, especially getting used to share my code, keyword: Git.<br/>
                            It also helped me to grow personally: living alone (finally) and making my own money, cosequently: Being entirely self-responsible.<br/>
                            I enjoy working at HUGO BOSS very much and in my opinion it's a reat company to work for and with. Having a beautiful big headquaters in Metzingen, Germany with many, friendly co-workers who all are ready to help and colaborate.</p>
                            <h3>WWDC17</h3>
                            <p>It was my greates honor to be invited to join &Tilde;5000 other developers and software engineers to WWDC17. <br/>
                            It was the first time I worked with Playgrounds on a real Project and it was both fun and pain to 'write' my PlaygroundBook. And it was even harder, give that I was about to graduate and that my finals started a few days after the deadline for application. <br/>
                            I cannot say in words how HYPED I was nor the hight that I was jumping, when I finally revieved <i>that</i> email for the first time in my life.<br/>
                            The conference helped me a lot to have a deeper understanding of Swift and it got me into some very cool new APIs which would be important for my further career. Furthermore it realy did a great job in connecting me with other developers, even around me. I got to know one of the founders of the #WWDCScholars: Sam Eckert and a some other Apple&trade; enthusiasts. One of them eventually tuned out to be my future fellow student.
