        <h1>HUGO BOSS - QualiyFeedback App - UserTest</h1>
        <div style="border: 2px solid gray;"><p><b>Note:</b> This app includes a scanner. To fully test all functionalities of this app, you will need a QR or bar code to scan. If you don't have one at hand at the moment, you could use another device to search the internet for pictures of QR or bar codes and use them to test the app.</p></div>
        <h2><a href="itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://www.thisisthefoxe.me/assets/apps/manifest.plist">Start App Download!</a></h2>
        <img style="width: 15%;" alt="QR code" src="./QR.svg"/>
        <div>
            <h3>How to install</h3>
        <p>Once you clicked the install-link or scanned the QR code, you should see an alert that asks you to install the app. Once you tap "Install" the app is being installed on the background. You should find it on your home screen.<br/>
        Before you can open it you will have to trust the HUGO BOSS developer certificate, otherwise you will get an error like: "Untrusted enterprise Developer". If you get an error like this, go to your <b>Settings app</b>. In the section <b>General -> Profiles &amp; Device Management</b> you will see the HUGO BOSS certificate. Tap on the certificate and then on "Trust HUGO BOSS AG". You will be asked one more time to confirm this action and then you are ready. Now you should be able to open the QualityFeedback App on your home screen. For further help see also <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204460">Apple Support</a><br/><br/>
        Have fun testing :)</p>
