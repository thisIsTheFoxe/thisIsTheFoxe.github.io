            <p>
                Ever since I first visited the West Coast of America, I had the dream of leaving Germany. I don't know
                why, but it was very hard for me to imagine a future where I would live in the same country for the rest
                of my life. But after graduating from high school, I was accepted for a cooperative study program.
                During this time (especially after spending some time in Manchester), my focus shifted from the US to
                New Zealand. I applied for a working holiday visa and was accepted. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, I
                was not able to enter the country as planned after graduating. So I had to spend my time and money doing
                something else.<br />
                I always had the dream of flying. But because of my eyesight, I also knew that I would not be able to
                pursue a career in aviation unless I had eye surgery. However, many of my friends
                (including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mbobpro.com/blog/3.html">Marko</a>) inspired me to pursue
                a private pilot's license (PPL) in the years leading up to 2021. And that's what I
                did! The closest aerodrome was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.airport-heubach.com/">EDTH</a> and my training
                aircraft was a Grob <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grob_G_115">G115</a>.
                There have been ups and downs, but there are few feelings like being in control of an aircraft and
                flying it yourself.... And I'm very proud to say that at the end of the year, I successfully completed
                my practical flight exam and can now call myself a real pilot.

            <a href="https://github.com/thisIsTheFoxe/WWDC20">Link to my 2020 Playground</a>
            <p>
                2020 was an interesting year. The COVID-19 pandemic changed everything. One of the small changes was the
                renaming of #WWDCScholars to #SwiftStudentChallenge. The bigger change was that the entire WWDC would be
                hosted as an online-only event. For that reason (and because I was busy writing my bachelor's thesis),
                I did not put as much work into my playground as in my previous submissions.<br />
                However, I didn't want to just give up, especially knowing and supporting the entire community
                that formed around this event. So, I gave myself 24 hours right when they announced #WWDC20.
                Within this time I came up with the idea to make a little 2D SpriteKit game
                about my favorite TV show, Community. I used some third-party assets and put it all together nicely
                to create a 2-minute interactive experience. At the end I wrote my essays and submitted
                everything in time. That was the earliest I have ever submitted a WWDCScholars
                submission.<br />
                As expected, my work was too quick & dirty to receive special attention. That makes me happy, because it
                proves (at least to me) that Apple's judgment process is working and fair (contrary to what others have
                claimed).<br />
                Since I am finishing my studies, #WWDC20 will probably be the last time I submitted a student
                submission. I
                did have a lot of fun and I'm sure that I will cherish all the experiences I was able to make for the
                rest of my life.
            </p>
            <h3 id="WWDC19">WWDC19</h3>
            <a href="https://github.com/thisIsTheFoxe/WWDC19">Link to my 2019 PlaygroundBook</a>
            <p>
                By now I've been quite active in the WWDCScholars community.
                It felt so good getting Slack and Telegram notification from all those WWDC groups again, which all have
                been pretty silent for almost a year now...
                (Btw, since 2019 there exists a new OFFICIAL WWDCScholars Discord Server!
                For more information contact me or anyone else from the WWDCScholars Team)
                ..And as soon as Apple announced WWDC19, I too began to think about participating.<br />
                I ended up with an idea that I got from a "Formal Languages and Automata" lecture I had at university.
                The thing that impressed me the most was the fact that with a few basic operations you could calculate
                virtually everything!
                So I decided to create my own programing language which would only use emoji and, as said, just a few
                basic
                operations, because why not? :D<br />
                The name of this language is: <i>DubDubMachine</i> and you can also find the specs on
                <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/DubDubMachine">esolangs.org</a><br />
                Sadly (and due to <q>a record-breaking number of incredible [...] submissions</q>), my PlaygroundsBook
                wasn't accepted for a scholarship this year...
                However, I had a blast enjoying the Keynote and especially trying out new stuff with SwiftUI and I
                already have plans to use it in my next projects.
                Also, as many other scholars put it: <br />
                <q>This year showed me how special the WWDC really is and what an immense privilege it is to be invited
                    there.</q> I will definitely not give up now and couldn't be more exited about #WWDC20
            </p>
            <h3 id="WWDC18">WWDC18</h3>
            <a href="https://github.com/thisIsTheFoxe/WWDC18">Link to my 2018 PlaygroundBook</a>
            <p>
                After I had such an awesome experience last year, I couldn't have been more exited when I saw Apple's
                announcement for &#xF8FF; WWDC18. Once again, I worked hard, while being enrolled in a full-time study
                program, to apply for a scholarship.<br />
                So, I again had the great privilege to join 350 as-amazing scholars from all over the world
                for one week in San Jos&eacute;.
                Not only that, but this time, right at the start we had the honor to visit the Steve Jobs Theater
                right next to &#xF8FF; Park! It was breathtaking. Everything is designed perfectly, just as you
                would it expect from a company like Apple&trade;.<br />
                The conference itself was no less exciting. With macOS dark mode, ARKit 2.0 and CreateML and so much
                more stuff it was a very awesome week.<br />
                Being there for the second time now, I was able to get much more out of it than last time. In fact, the
                motivational boost I received after dubDub continued for some time, which made me continue working on
                private projects...<br />
                Of course I also met many fellow developers, including Frederik Riedel, Amanda Southworth and Felix
                Krause.
                The &#xF8FF; World Wide Developer Conference always is a unique experience and I'm very glad I've been a
                part of that.

                After graduating from High School in winter 2017, I joined an integrated degree program (lit.
                "dual-study") at HUGO BOSS.<br />
                It took me some time to get used to working within a big company and all organizational matters,
                especially getting used to sharing my code, keyword: Git.<br />
                It also helped me to grow personally. Living alone (finally) and making my own money, consequently:
                Being entirely self-responsible.<br />
                I enjoyed working at HUGO BOSS very much and in my opinion it's a great company to work for and with.
                Having a beautiful big headquarters in Metzingen, Germany with many, friendly co-workers who all are
                ready to help and collaborate.</p>

            <p>
                It was my greatest honor to be invited to join &Tilde;5000 other developers and software engineers at
                &#xF8FF; WWDC17. <br />
                It was the first time I worked with Playgrounds on a real project and it was both fun and exhausting to
                'write' my PlaygroundBook. And it was even harder, given that I was about to graduate from high school
                and that my finals started a few days after the deadline for application. <br />
                I cannot say in words how HYPED I was, nor the hight that I was jumping, when I finally received
                <b>that</b> email for the first time in my life.<br />
                The conference helped me a lot to have a deeper understanding of Swift and it got me into some very cool
                new APIs which would be important for my further career.
                Furthermore, it really did a great job in connecting me with other developers, even within my area.
                I got to know one of the founders of the #WWDCScholars: Sam Eckert and a some other Apple enthusiasts.
                One of them eventually tuned out to be my future fellow
                student.<br />

                After taking an 'ordinary' school career for almost 10 years, I made the choice to do something new.
                So, I switched schools and spent my final 3 high school years studying computer science, programming and
                digital engineering. I eventually graduated in April 2017.<br />
                This gave me a very strong knowledge base in the field of computer science that I would need later on in
                my life.<br />

                The very first Internship I had, was back in 2012. It was an IT-Company which also was an authorized
                reseller
                of Apple&trade; products. <br />
                I really enjoyed it and it increased my interest in technology.<br />
